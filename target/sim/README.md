# Simulation

This is the simulation target directory. It contains the C++ and SystemVerilog sources for all testbenches and simulations.

Read more in [`docs/SIMULATION.md`](../../docs/SIMULATION.md) or build with:

```bash
make all
```

Build the full SoC simulator or load an RV32 ELF through JTAG with:

```bash
make soc
make jtag ELF=/path/to/program.elf
```

Direct JTAG memory access:

```bash
obj_dir_soc/vernii_soc read <address> <size>
obj_dir_soc/vernii_soc write <address> <byte> [byte ...]
obj_dir_soc/vernii_soc load <program.elf>
```

## apheleiaOS

`scripts/aos.sh` fetches and builds apheleiaOS into a gitignored `build_aos/`, then boots it; an existing image is booted rather than rebuilt. Pass `rebuild` to force a new one. Building needs clang, ld.lld and dtc.

```bash
scripts/aos.sh
```

`scripts/run_aos.sh` boots an image that is already built, and takes the same environment as `test`:

```bash
scripts/run_aos.sh build_aos/apheleiaOS/bin/apheleia_1.0_riscv_32.img
```

The image runs from external memory with the whole SRAM left as cache, so the memory is sized past its default. Its boot stub assumes a boot ROM programmed the UART divisor and never does it itself, which is what `UART_DIV` covers. Reaching the login prompt takes about half an hour.

| Variable | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEM_SIZE` | 268435456 | external memory bytes |
| `LLCSEL` | 0xf | ways used as cache rather than scratchpad |
| `UART_DIV` | 27 | 16550 divisor, 115200 baud from 50 MHz |
| `CYCLES` | 20000000000 | cycle limit |
| `BOOT` | jtag | `qspi` to boot through the ROM and the flash |

`BOOT=qspi` is the path the chip itself takes. Rather than having the debug module place the image in memory, it packs the second stage and the image into a flash image, and the boot ROM reads it over QSPI:

```bash
BOOT=qspi scripts/run_aos.sh build_aos/apheleiaOS/bin/apheleia_1.0_riscv_32.img
```

The ROM copies the first block into the OCM and jumps to it; that stage turns on the external memory, sets the divisor, streams the image into RAM and hands over. `LLCSEL` does not apply, the second stage switches the ways itself. Streaming 3 MB over SPI adds a few minutes before the console starts.

Start the SoC simulation and debug server from the repository root:

```bash
make -C target/sim debug
```

GDB can then connect from another terminal:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb program.elf
(gdb) target extended-remote 127.0.0.1:3333
(gdb) load
```
